    <h1>My Meeting with Three Builders</h1>
    <p>I set out to learn how websites work and met three technologies that shape the web.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>The First Builder: HTML</h2>

    <img src="img/html.jpg" alt="An illustration representing HTML structure" />
    <p>This was the foundation layer, the skeleton of every page. It focused on defining
      <span>"content and structure"</span> the layout, headings, paragraphs, and images that form the web’s body.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Second Builder: CSS</h2>

    <img src="img/css.jpg" alt="A visualization of style and web design" />
    <p>This builder didn’t worry about structure, only appearance. It dressed the web with colors, spacing, layouts,
      fonts, and animations, making everything more appealing and modern.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Third Builder: JavaScript</h2>

    <img src="img/js.jpg" alt="An abstract representation of interactive behavior" />
    <p>The final builder brought websites to life. It allowed buttons to react, data to update, and users to interact
      without reloading the page. It added behavior and intelligence where none existed before.</p>
